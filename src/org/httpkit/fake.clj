  #'org.httpkit.client/request.

  The spec argument is a vector of key-value pairs—as in a let binding form—in
  which the keys contain a predicate for the request and the values are the
  responses to be returned.

  The predicates may take one of the following forms:

    1. A function accepting a Map (request opts) and returning true on a match.
    2. A String, which must be an exact match on the URL.
    3. A Regex, which must match on the URL.
    4. A Map, whose keys and values must match the same keys and values in the
       request. Values may be specified as Regexes.

  The responses may take one of the following forms:

    1. A function accepting the actual (unstubbed) #'org.httpkit.client/request
       fn, the request opts Map and a callback function as arguments.
    2. A String, which is then used as the :body of the response.
    3. An Integer, which is then used as the :status of the response.
    4. A Map, which is used as the actual response Map, merged with some
       defaults.
    5. The keyword :allow, which whitelists this request and allows the real
       connection.
    6. The keyword :deny, which blacklists this request and throws an
       IllegalArgumentException if it is attempted.

  Each predicate is tested in the order in which they are specified. As soon as
  the first predicate matches, the response is invoked. If none of the
  predicates match, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown and the request is
  disallowed.
